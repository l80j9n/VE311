In   the   vibrant   city   of Innovatech,   there   was   a   skilled   engineer   named   Sam   who   worked   for   a   cutting-edge   tech   company   called   ElectroWorks.At work, Sam was tasked with developing a new high-performance amplifier.    Sam’s   journey   began   with   the   common   source   amplifier.    which   is   known   for   its   high   gain,   seeming   like   a   great   starting   point.      Sam   set   up   the   circuit,   measuring   its   performance.    The   results   were   impressive,   and   the   amplified   signal   was   clear   and   strong.      Sam   felt   a   surge   of   excitement,   seeing   the   theoretical   knowledge   come   to   life.
Question 1.    Common Source 
Assume   that   all   MOSFETs   are   in   saturation,   calculate   the   small-signal   voltage   gain   of each   circuit.    (λ   ≠   0,γ   =   0)
To   have   a   better   understanding   of the   quantified   properties   of the   common   source   circuit,   he   built   a   simple   model   and   decided   to   do   some   precise   calculations   with   it.    After   careful   considerations,   he   found   out   that   his   circuits   perfectly   satisfies   the   task.
Question 2.    Common Source with Diode-connected Load (Lunatic) 
Consider   the   following   circuit   with      (W/L)1         =   50/0.5   and      (W/L)2         =      10/0.5.    Assume   that λ   = γ   = 0.    Then   3   V   for   VDD   ,   0.7   V   for   VTH1
1)   At what input voltage is   M1      at the   edge   of the   triode   region?   What   is   the   small-signal   gain   under   this   condition?
2)   What   input   voltage   drives   M1      into   the   triode   region   by   50mV   ?    What   is   the   small-   signal   gain   under   this   condition?
However, the   project 代 写VE311 Electronic Circuit Homework 7R
代做程序编程语言  requirements   demanded   more   than   just   high   gain.       The   amplifier   needed   to   handle   high   frequencies   eﬀiciently,   which   led Sam   to   explore   the   common   gate   amplifier, which has unique properties of   low input impedance and good high-frequency   response. Sam spent late nights in   the lab, tweaking      and   testing, until   they achieved a   configuration   that   performed   well   at   the   required   frequencies.
Question 3.    Common Gate Common Source (Medium) 
Find   the   intrinsic   gain   Av      and   output   impedance   Rout    for   the   amplifier   when   I1    =   0.01   and   0.1mA   respectively.    (Neglect   body   effect)Parameter   for   NMOS:   VTHN      = 0.7V   ,   Kn      =   110µA/V2   ,λ   =   0.04V−1Parameter   for   PMOS:   VTHP      =   −0.7V   ,   Kp      = 50µA/V2   ,λ =   0.05V−1All   the   size   of   transistor   is   W   = 20µm,   L   =   1µm
The   real   test   came   when   Sam   decided   to   combine   the   strengths   of   both   configurations   into   a   cascode   amplifier.    This   was   a   complex   task   that   required   precise   tuning   and   a   deep   understanding   of both   common   source   and   common   gate   amplifiers.    Sam   dove   into   research   papers, consulted with colleagues, and ran numerous simulations.   Each iteration of   the design   brought them closer to the desired   outcome. The lab   became   a   second   home,   with   Sam   often   working   through   weekends   to   perfect   the   design.
Question 4.    Common Gate Common Source (Medium) 
Find   the   intrinsic   gain   Av      and   output   impedance   Rout    for   the   amplifier   when   I1    =   0.01   and   0.1mA   respectively.    (Neglect   body   effect)Parameter   for   NMOS:   VTHN      = 0.7V   ,   Kn      =   110µA/V2   ,λ   =   0.04V−1Parameter   for   PMOS:   VTHP      =   −0.7V   ,   Kp      = 50µA/V2   ,λ =   0.05V−1All   the   size   of   transistor   is   W   = 20µm,   L   =   1µm
